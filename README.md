# lazy-blackjack
blackjack but its only on the command line terminal and its coded in C++ because im not going to learn a UI library for C++ because C++. <br />
~~Oh yeah. Its also single player only~~ nvm read the rules. Multiplayer can totally be done but if you want to play like that you'll have to pass the device around and thats just weird so.... yea still single player only but not for the original reason.
